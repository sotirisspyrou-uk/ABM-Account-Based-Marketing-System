## 📊 Decision-Making Framework

### Account Prioritization Logic
```python
def prioritize_accounts(self, accounts: List[Account]) -> List[PrioritizedAccount]:
    """
    PRIORITY SCORING ALGORITHM:
    1. Financial Health Score (0-100) * 0.30
    2. Intent Probability (0-1) * 0.40  
    3. Deal Size Potential (normalized) * 0.20
    4. Competitive Vulnerability (0-1) * 0.10
    
    ACTIONS:
    - Score > 80: Immediate high-touch outreach
    - Score 60-80: Automated nurture sequence
    - Score 40-60: Content marketing focus
    - Score < 40: Long-term awareness building
    """
```

### Content Optimization Logic
```python
def optimize_content(self, context: AccountContext, objective: str) -> OptimizedContent:
    """
    PERSONALIZATION FACTORS:
    1. Industry-specific pain points and solutions
    2. Company size and sophistication level
    3. Decision-maker role and communication preferences
    4. Competitive context and differentiation needs
    5. Timing and urgency indicators
    
    OPTIMIZATION TARGETS:
    - Open rates: Industry average + 50%
    - Click rates: Industry average + 75%
    - Response rates: Industry average + 100%
    """
```
